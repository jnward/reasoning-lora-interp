Hmm, let me think. First, I know that a number divisible by 30 has to be divisible by both 10 and 3. Because 30 factors into 10 and 3, right? So if a number is divisible by 30, it must end in 0 (to be divisible by 10",
  "baseline": ") and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3 (for divisibility by 3). \n\nSo, given that, any such number must end with a 0. But since we can only use the digits 0 and 2, the last digit has to be 0. That makes sense. Then, all other digits can be either 0 or 2. Also, the sum of the digits needs to be divisible by 3. Let me note down these requirements:\n\n",

However, the first digit can't be0, except for the case where the entire number is0, but we're looking for positive integers, so first digit has to be2.\n\nSo,",
    "56": ") and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3 (to be divisible by 3). Okay, that seems like a good starting point.\n\nSo, we're looking for a number that: \n- Ends with 0, because it's a multiple of 10, and \n- The sum of its digits is a multiple of 3, because it's a multiple of 3, \n- And it's made up only of 0s and 2s, except",
    "57": ") and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3 (for divisibility by 3). \n\nSo, since the number needs to end with a 0, the last digit must be 0. But all digits have to be either 0 or 2. So, the last digit is 0, which is allowed. Then, for the rest of the digits, they can be 0s or 2s, as long as the entire number is a multiple of ",
    "58": ") and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3 (for divisibility by 3). \n\nSo, since the number has to end with a 0, the last digit is 0. All the other digits can be 0 or 2. Also, the sum of all the digits (except the last one, which is 0) must be a multiple of 3. Since all the digits are 0 or 2, the sum will be a multiple of ",
    "59": ") and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3 (for divisibility by3).\n\nSo let me break this down:\n\n1. The number must end with 0 because any number divisible by10 ends with0.\n2. The sum of its digits must be divisible by3.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the number can only contain the digits0and2. So if it ends with0, then maybe the other digits are2s?\n\nLet me recap:\n- The",
    "60": ") and the sum of its digits must be divisible by  3 (for divisibility by 3). \n\nWait, but since the number has to end in 0, but the only digits allowed are 0 and 2, that means the last digit has to be 0. Got it. Then, for the rest of the number, which consists of 0s and 2s, the sum of the digits (excluding the last 0) plus 0 (the last",
    "61": ") and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3 (for divisibility by 3). \n\nSo, given that, any such number we're looking for must end with a 0. But wait, the problem states it can only use the digits 0 and 2. If it ends with a 0, that's fine because 0 is one of the allowed digits. But all other digits can be either 0 or 2. Also, since it's a positive",
    "62": ") and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3 (for divisibility by 3). \n\nTherefore, since the number has to end with 0, but the digits allowed are only 0 and 2, the last digit has to be 0, which works because 0 is allowed. Therefore, our number will look like [some combination of 2s and 0s followed by a 0]. But the problem states “written with only the digits 0 and",
    "63": ") and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.\n\nAh, yes. Divisibility rules. Same as other numbers.\n\nFirst, since the number has to end with a 0 to be divisible by 10. But in this problem, we can only use digits 0 and 2. Therefore, the last digit has to be 0.\n\nSame time.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, any possible number that meets this would have to end with a 0.\n\nBut other digits"
